MICT Based Framework for the Openworm Project

## MICT Framework for Modeling C. elegans (Conceptual Outline)

This repository explores the application of the **Mobius Inspired Cyclical Transformation (MICT)** framework, specifically its hierarchical extension (HCTS), as a potential conceptual and computational structure for modeling the nematode worm *Caenorhabditis elegans*.

**Inspired by OpenWorm:**

This project is deeply inspired by the groundbreaking work of the **OpenWorm project** ([https://openworm.org/](https://openworm.org/)), which aims to create the first complete *in silico* model of *C. elegans*. We acknowledge the immense contributions and dedication of the OpenWorm community over the past decade.

**Our Goal:**

Our goal is *not* to replicate or replace the OpenWorm effort, but to offer a complementary framework – MICT/HCTS – that might help **structure, organize, and model** the complex, multi-level dynamics of the worm. We believe the principles of iterative cycles, interconnectedness, emergence, and hierarchy embedded in MICT/HCTS could provide a valuable lens for simulating this biological system.

**Proposed Hierarchical Model:**

We propose modeling *C. elegans* using nested MICT cycles at different levels of organization:

*   **Level 1: Cellular Cycles:** Modeling individual neurons, muscle cells, etc.
*   **Level 2: Component Cycles:** Modeling neural circuits, muscle groups, etc.
*   **Level 3: System Cycles:** Modeling the nervous system, muscular system, etc.
*   **Level 4: Organism Cycle:** Modeling the overall behavior of the worm in its environment.

**(Link to `docs/hierarchical_model.md` for more details)**

**Current Status:**

This repository currently provides:

*   A conceptual outline of the hierarchical MICT/HCTS model for *C. elegans*.
*   Basic code skeletons and templates (in Python/JavaScript) for implementing MICT cycles at different levels.
*   Simple examples demonstrating the core concepts.

**This is a *work in progress* and a *call for collaboration*.**

**How MICT/HCTS Can Help:**

We believe MICT/HCTS could potentially benefit the OpenWorm project and related research by providing:

*   A modular and scalable framework for managing complexity.
*   A way to model adaptive processes and learning at different levels.
*   A structured approach for integrating data from different sources.
*   A platform for simulating emergent behavior.

**Get Involved:**
