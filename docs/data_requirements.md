# Data Requirements for MICT/HCTS C. elegans Model

Building and validating a comprehensive *in silico* model of *C. elegans* using the MICT/HCTS framework requires integrating diverse biological data spanning multiple scales. This document outlines the key types of data needed, many of which are being actively curated and generated by the [OpenWorm project](https://openworm.org/) and the broader *C. elegans* research community.

## I. Data for Model Parameterization (Mapping & Iteration Stages)

These data are essential for defining the initial state and the dynamic rules governing the MICT cycles at different levels.

1.  **Connectome Data:**
    *   **Description:** The complete wiring diagram of the *C. elegans* nervous system, including neuron identities, synaptic connections (chemical and electrical), and synaptic weights (excitatory/inhibitory).
    *   **MICT Use:** Defining connections between `CellMICT` instances for neurons; parameterizing synaptic interaction logic in the `Iteration` stage.
    *   **Sources:** OpenWorm connectome data, WormWiring project, relevant publications (e.g., White et al., 1986; Cook et al., 2019).

2.  **Cell Type Data:**
    *   **Description:** Classification and properties of all ~1000 cells, including neurons (sensory, inter, motor), muscle cells (body wall, specialized), epithelial cells, etc.
    *   **MICT Use:** Defining the `cell_type` for each `CellMICT` instance; selecting appropriate biophysical models for the `Iteration` stage.
    *   **Sources:** WormAtlas, WormBase, OpenWorm cell lists, relevant literature.

3.  **Biophysical Models and Parameters:**
    *   **Description:** Mathematical equations and parameters describing the behavior of individual cells.
        *   **Neurons:** Ion channel kinetics (e.g., Hodgkin-Huxley parameters if available, simpler models like Leaky Integrate-and-Fire), resting potentials, firing thresholds, synaptic dynamics (release probabilities, time constants).
        *   **Muscle Cells:** Models of muscle contraction mechanics, force generation parameters, calcium dynamics.
    *   **MICT Use:** Implementing the core logic within the `Iteration` stage of `CellMICT` cycles.
    *   **Sources:** OpenWorm subprojects (e.g., c302 simulation), relevant biophysical modeling literature, electrophysiological recordings (where available).

4.  **Gene Expression Data:**
    *   **Description:** Information on which genes are expressed in which cells and under what conditions.
    *   **MICT Use:** (Advanced) Modeling cell differentiation, plasticity, and long-term adaptation within the `Transformation` stage of `CellMICT` cycles.
    *   **Sources:** WormBase, single-cell sequencing data, relevant publications.

5.  **Anatomical Data:**
    *   **Description:** Physical locations and shapes of cells and tissues.
    *   **MICT Use:** Defining spatial relationships for modeling mechanical interactions or diffusion; visualization.
    *   **Sources:** WormAtlas, electron microscopy data.

## II. Data for Model Validation (Checking Stage)

These data are crucial for comparing the simulation's output to real-world observations and refining the model.

1.  **Behavioral Data:**
    *   **Description:** Quantitative data on worm locomotion (e.g., speed, curvature, reversal frequency), chemotaxis, thermotaxis, response to touch, feeding behavior, etc.
    *   **MICT Use:** Validating the output of the `OrganismMICT` cycle. Comparing simulated behavior to real worm behavior.
    *   **Sources:** WormBase behavior section, published tracking experiments (videos and data), OpenWorm movement database.

2.  **Neural Activity Data:**
    *   **Description:** Recordings of neural activity, primarily through calcium imaging (as whole-brain electrophysiology is difficult in *C. elegans*). Data showing activity patterns in specific neurons or circuits during particular behaviors.
    *   **MICT Use:** Validating the output of `CellMICT` (neurons) and `ComponentMICT` (circuits). Comparing simulated neural activity patterns to experimental recordings.
    *   **Sources:** Relevant neuroscience publications, Calcium C. elegans database, OpenWorm data resources.

3.  **Laser Ablation Studies:**
    *   **Description:** Experimental results where specific neurons are ablated (destroyed) and the resulting effect on behavior is observed.
    *   **MICT Use:** Validating the functional role of specific neurons and circuits within the simulation. Simulating ablations by removing or silencing specific `CellMICT` instances and comparing the resulting behavior to experimental data.
    *   **Sources:** Relevant developmental biology and neuroscience literature.

## III. Data Challenges and Collaboration

*   **Completeness:** Obtaining complete and accurate data for all ~1000 cells and their interactions is a major challenge.
*   **Variability:** There is natural variability between individual worms.
*   **Data Integration:** Integrating data from different sources and formats requires careful curation.

**Call for Data Contributions:**

We strongly encourage the community to contribute relevant datasets and models. Accurate and comprehensive data is essential for building and validating a realistic *in silico* model of *C. elegans*. Please refer to the OpenWorm project for existing data resources and contribution guidelines.

This framework highlights the critical need for diverse biological data to both parameterize and validate the proposed MICT/HCTS model of *C. elegans*. Collaboration with the OpenWorm community and leveraging their existing data resources will be essential for the success of this project.
